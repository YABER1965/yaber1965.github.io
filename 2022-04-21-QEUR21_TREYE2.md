## [Name of invention] 

Image recognition method (improvement of performance and robustness for anomaly detection and simple discrimination method)

## [Technology field]

This invention relates to computer-based image recognition and generic discrimination techniques.

## [Technology background]

Various computer-based image recognition schemes have been developed through AI contests, etc., and deep learning has recently been highly appreciated its high level of discrimination performance (Fig. 1).

**(Fig. 1: Transition of image recognition technology)**

![image3-11-1](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image3-11-1.jpg)

The analysis flow diagram of general machine learning is shown below (Fig. 2). Preprocessing of input data is also an important technology for recognition, but it has not made much progress.

**(Fig. 2: Machine learning flowchart)**

![image3-11-2](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image3-11-2.jpg)

The popular methods of data preprocessing are shown in the table below (Figs. 3 and 4). As for method of compressing image, it is currently common to remove high-order principal components having low contri-bution rate by principal component analysis (PCA).

**(Fig. 3: Data preprocessing)**

However, only one product has these three characteristics, and many products cannot automate visual inspection based on image differences.

The concept of Mahalanobis distance which is widely used for discriminant analysis of multidimensional data is shown at the figure below(Fig. 6). It is required to set a threshold value when Mahalanobis distance is applied for discrimination. Mahalanobis distance has a disadvantage which requires a large amount of data for calculation, and which cannot be calculated if it has multicollinearity.


**(Fig. 6: Mahalanobis distance concept)**

![image3-11-6](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image3-11-6.jpg)

Furthermore, even if Mahalanobis distance could be calculated, it does not necessarily mean that the dis-crimination performance would be satisfied by users. It might be necessary to improve by adding members to the unit space or changing data collection or measurement method itself.

**(Fig. 7: Role of unit space doe Mahalanobis distance)**

### [Problems to be solved by this invention.]

As for computer image recognition, it is getting easier to classify images (eg, photos are for dogs or cats?). However, it is still difficult to detect partial anomalies which is in three-dimensional object.

When visually inspecting was conducted for industrial product to detect an abnormality, the situation of standard product and the inspected product is exactly the same except for a part of abnormality. Therefore, the amount of information (signals) to determine product abnormalities is extremely small.

On the other hand, visual inspection has a lot of disturbance (noise). Typical examples are shift, rotation, and light source conditions of testing objects. it is likely difficult to distinguish because noise can be larg-er than signal in visual inspection.

### [Means to solve problems.] 

This invention improves RT (Recognition Taguchi) method which is one of the Taguchi methods used for quality improvement as a preprocessing process for image recognition. However, sensitivity and SN ratio of total of 5 cameras are processed in X and Y directions instead of calculating distance as conventional method (Fig. 8). Hereafter. this invention is called as the Five Eyes method (FE method for short) since five cameras (eyes) are applied.

**(Fig. 8: concept of Five Eyes method)**

![image3-11-8](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image3-11-8.jpg)

FE method is an extension of "new double-eyed method" already explained. A differences between double-eyed method and new one are shown below, but please refer to the related documents for a detailed expla-nation (Fig. 9).

**(Fig. 9: Comparison between double-eye method and the new double-eye method)**

![image3-11-9](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image3-11-9.jpg)

Expanding new double-eyed method to X-axis and Y-axis enhances robustness and performance to detect stereoscopic effects. At the same time, high discrimination ability could be obtained by evaluating the same metrics from X and Y directions even if the object was rotated.

When using visual inspection machine, it is recommended to install one at the start of mass production. However, conventional methods cannot keep up with visual inspection machines because amount of prod-uct inspection data obtained during product development process is not sufficient. Therefore, it is needed a method (new MT method) that can perform "acceptable inspection" with less data.

The analysis flow of **automatic visual inspection machine** of this invention is shown below (Fig. 10). The first half of processing flow is FE method, and the second half is new MT method.


**(Fig. 10: Analysis flow of this invention [FE method + new MT method])**

![image3-11-10](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image3-11-10.jpg)

**(Fig. 11: Average image of unit space)**

![image3-11-11](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image3-11-11.jpg)

FE method divides the image appropriately to calculate matrix of RT metrics. The image as figure below is divided into 50x50 pixels, and these metrics are evaluated to create a mask file (Fig. 12). The position where value is 1 means "measurement cell (area)".

**(Fig. 12: Contents of mask file)**

![image3-11-12](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image3-11-12.jpg)

An orthogonal array of experimental design is applied to evaluate effect of RT metrics on each cell pre-cisely (Figure 13). Orthogonal array is helpful to calculate main effect of each cell.

**(Fig. 13: Orthogonal array)**

![image3-11-13](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image3-11-13.jpg)

Metric differences can be calculated from main effects between standard objects (NORMAL) and abnor-mal one (ERROR) (Figure 14). And mask file is created from differences significant for extracting data (Figure 15). This significance criterion is user-determined.

**(Fig. 14: Calculation of main effect)**

![image3-11-14](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image3-11-14.jpg)

**(Fig. 15: Contents of mask file)**

![image3-11-15](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image3-11-15.jpg)

This is the explanation of Five Eyes (FE) method. Furthermore, situation of the defect can be clear if main effect calculated by FE method is displayed to inspector (operator).

The input to new MT method is RT metrics extracted with the mask file. There are four types of metrics in the data (“X direction-sensitivity difference”, “X direction-SN ratio difference”, “Y direction-sensitivity difference”, “Y direction-SN ratio difference”). For the following example, the number of data extracted from the mask file is 13 items, so total number of metrics is 13x4 = 52 items. (Fig. 16). 

**(Fig. 16: Input to the new MT method)**

![image3-11-16](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image3-11-16.jpg)

Likely RT method, T method (2) can work under small number of measurement data even if the process has a large number of items (explanatory variable Xs). The sensitivity and SN ratio of each item are ob-tained as a result of T method (2) analysis. 

**(Fig. 17: Comparison of similarity)**

![image3-11-17](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image3-11-17.jpg)

Data of rotation (XYZ) and deformation (Err) of the object have been added to the above figure. Principal components in the above figure are explanatory variables (Xs), and XYZ-Err are response variables (Ys). A characteristic formula (Ys = f (Xs) should be solved with T method (2) to calculate sensitivity and SN ra-tio of each item (Fig. 18). 

**(Fig. 18: Calculation result of SN ratio of each item by T method)**

![image3-11-18](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image3-11-18.jpg)

Items (Xs: explanatory variables) with large S/N ratio for each item calculated by T method (2) indicates that the influence on response variable (Ys) are large. Whereas principal components related to XYZ be-come noise (error factor), which having a large SN ratio are unnecessary for discrimination, and Err be-comes signal (signal factor), which principal component having a large SN ratio is necessary for discrimi-nation. 

## [Example_1]

The image of 3D CG model used in this case study is shown below. This CG software can install multiple cameras into virtual space to take multiple images at the same time (Fig. 19). The object can be rotated around XYZ axes according to orthogonal table in the Python program, and images were taken below(Fig. 20). 

**(Fig. 19: 3D CG (Blender) model)**

![image3-11-19](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image3-11-19.jpg)

**(Fig. 20: group of captured images)**

![image3-11-20](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image3-11-20.jpg)

Six types of subjects were created as learning data (TRAIN) and verification data (TEST) (Fig. 21). Part of shape or color of objects have been changed accordingly (Figs. 22 and 23). 

**(Fig. 21: Concept of objects)**

![image3-11-21](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image3-11-21.jpg)

**(Fig. 22: Training data (TRAIN) group)**

![image3-11-22](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image3-11-22.jpg)

**(Fig. 23: Verification data (TEST) group)**

![image3-11-23](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image3-11-23.jpg)

FE method calculates various metrics (total sensitivity, total SN ratio, sensitivity difference, SN ratio difference) toward X and Y directions by double -eyed method using RT method (Figs. 24 and 25). Since the same object is measured toward X and Y directions, metrics of X and Y directions should have multicollin-earity. 

**(Fig. 24: RT metrics distribution in the X direction)**

![image3-11-24](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image3-11-24.jpg)

**(Fig. 25: RT metrics distribution in the Y direction)**

![image3-11-25](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image3-11-25.jpg)

Cumulative contribution of principal component is shown below (Fig. 26). It is planned to use top 10 components for this case study, but it is considered that contribution of 60% or more is sufficient. (Note that components with noise will be eliminated later). 

**(Fig. 26: calculation result of Principal component contribution rate)**

![image3-11-26](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image3-11-26.jpg)

Instead of Mahalanobis distance, new MT method calculates Euclid distance from principal component optimized by important item analysis with T method. Mathematically, Euclid distance calculated from principal component is equivalent to Mahalanobis distance (Fig. 27). 

**(Fig. 27: Euclid distance and Mahalanobis distance)**

![image3-11-27](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image3-11-27.jpg)

Principal components are selected based on a concept of **"error(noise) factors, signal factors"** for new MT method (Fig. 28). Distance calculated from the principal components after eliminating principal compo-nents affected by error factor to remain one affected by the signal factor will raise S/N ratio. 

**(Fig. 28: Concept of data optimization of new MT method)**

![image3-11-28](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image3-11-28.jpg)

**(Fig. 29: Reprint-Calculation result of Item SN ratio by T method)**

![image3-11-29](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image3-11-29.jpg)

The distribution of Euclid distance which applied unit space for origin and all of principal components (N = 13) induced from entire training data are shown below. None of groups are significantly different from reference group (color NORMAL, shape NORMAL). 

**(Fig. 30: Unit space-whole training data, principal component-all)**

![image3-11-30](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image3-11-30.jpg)

A distance histogram eliminating principal components affected by error factors related to XYZ rotation under the same unit space is shown below. Error data group has been separated from normal data group and more clearly.

**(Fig. 31: Unit space-whole training data, principal component-selected)**

![image3-11-31](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image3-11-31.jpg)

Next, distances were calculated after changing unit space into data group of standard conditions in the same way. This distribution is similar as one using all of training data as the unit space shown above, no matter case using all of principal components or one selected. 

**(Fig. 32: Unit space-standard data group, principal component-all)**

![image3-11-32](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image3-11-32.jpg)

**(Fig. 33: Unit space-standard data group, principal component-selected)**

![image3-11-33](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image3-11-33.jpg)

Thus, it is possible establish an automatic visual inspection machine by collecting a relatively small amount of data if distances are calculated with unit space and error factor defined by new MT method. By the way, conventional MT method has a principle of data collection called0 "homogeneous" which named after an opening phrase of "Anna Karenina" of Tolstoy as a famous Russian literature.

### 「幸福な家庭はすべて互いに似通ったものであり、不幸な家庭はどこもその不幸の趣がことなているものである」（木村浩訳　新潮文庫）

Principle of “homogeneity” defined by Genichi Taguchi is difficult for prediction system to construct effi-ciently. The definition of new MT method can enhance consistency with other Taguchi methods.

## [Industrial applicability]

Five Eyes (FE method) in this invention is an extension of the previously proposed new double-eye meth-od and it is appropriated for image recognition of three-dimensional objects. In particular, it works effec-tively when it is applied for automation of visual inspection and automatic driving of automotive.

The method of measuring the main effect with orthogonal array is especially effective for visual inspec-tion automatic machines. SN ratio is likely lower when detecting partial abnormality of industrial product. The accuracy of discrimination would be lower. Therefore, it is effective to set the distance threshold low-er for over-detection to measure main effect and let user judge it at the same time (Fig. 34).

**(Fig. 34: Logic of visual inspection machine using main effect)**

![image3-11-34](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image3-11-34.jpg)

A technology to display main effect to user is equivalent to a technology called LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) in AI technology field (Fig. 35). Users will more trust in the visual inspec-tion machine by eliminating black boxing of visual inspection machine processing.

**(Fig. 35: Logic of visual inspection machine with main effect)**

![image3-11-35](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image3-11-35.jpg)

On the other hand, new MT method can be applied to various industrial computer recognition technologies. Furthermore, this metric (Euclid distance) can be used for quality improvement by setting error factors appropriately. 

Error factors reduce Euclid distance. In other word, the value was larger, effect on signal factor would be larger as well as one on error factor would be less. Therefore, S/N ratio of process would be larger.

Euclid distance is non-additive metric, and it is not appropriated to parameter design. However, it can be used for CS-T method to detect important items.
