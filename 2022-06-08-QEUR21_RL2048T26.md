## Re: RT (Recognition Taguchi) method and new RT method

### [Introduction]

RT method is a classification method proposed by Genichi Taguchi (田口 玄一, January 1, 1924-June 2, 2012, founder and engineer of Taguchi Method).

Genichi Taguchi proposed SN ratio (signal-to-noise ratio), which is a metric to evaluate quality performance in the 1980s. Then, he visited many companies that had many problems, and measured response of output under error factor added. And, he has made a number of remarkable achievements for product development and process improvement by solving equations with outer / inner orthogonal array (Fig. 1).

**(Fig. 1: Parameter design)**

In the beginning of 2000s, Genichi Taguchi proposed a new metric called standard SN ratio, which is used to minimize output variability in products and processes with non-linearly variable standard (ideal) signals. One of the typical improvement examples is the improvement and stabilization of click feeling of the keypad by improving its design. It was improved by optimizing the thickness of each part of the silicon plate as control factors (Fig. 2).

### [Mathematical understanding of RT method ①: Metrics Y1 and Y2]

RT method is a method that applies standard SN ratio to the classification problem of multivariate data although it is originally invented for improvement of product design and process.

Standard SN ratio evaluates the distribution of a non-linear signal by converting the standard signal value to the horizontal axis (Fig. 3). This conversion makes the distribution with proportional at origin, and its slope is defined as sensitivity, and its degree of variation from the standard signal is defined as SN ratio.

**(Fig. 3: Standard SN ratio)**

![imageRL1-25-3](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/imageRL1-25-3.jpg)

This section describes a calculation flow to obtain two types of metrics (Y1 and Y2) (Fig. 4).

**(Fig. 4: Process flow of RT method calculation)**

![imageRL1-25-4](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/imageRL1-25-4.jpg)

Unit space is defined as a "homogeneous group" to accumulates members (Xnk) that meet a condition. The mean value (Xk_bar) is calculated from the data in the unit space.

**(Fig. 5: Unit space data and linear equation)**

![imageRL1-25-5](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/imageRL1-25-5.jpg)

The subsequent calculation procedure is shown as follows (Figs. 6 and 7).

**(Fig.6: Sensitivity and SN-ratio -1)**

![imageRL1-25-6](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/imageRL1-25-6.jpg)

**(Fig.7: Sensitivity and SN-ratio -2)**

![imageRL1-25-7](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/imageRL1-25-7.jpg)

Thus, we have obtained sensitivity (β) and SN ratio (η). It is required to convert them to Y1 and Y2 to use them for classification, (Figures 8 and 9). These metrics calculated for each member are averaged by unit space to make Y1_bar and Y2_bar.

**(Fig. 8: Formula for Y1 and Y2)**

### [Mathematical understanding of RT method ②: RT Distance calculation]

Distance (D) is introduced in this section for reference although it is not used for this invention. Distance of RT method is calculated in similar way as the Mahalanobis distance of the multivariate normal distribution. However, RT method uses Cofactor matrix of variance-covariance matrix instead of the inverse matrix (Figs. 10 and 11).

**(Fig. 10: RT Distance Calculation-1)**

![imageRL1-25-10](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/imageRL1-25-10.jpg)

**(Fig. 11: RT Distance Calculation-2)**

![imageRL1-25-11](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/imageRL1-25-11.jpg)

Finally, RT distance is calculated as follows (Fig. 12).

**(Fig. 12: RT Distance Calculation-3)**

![imageRL1-25-12](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/imageRL1-25-12.jpg)

### [Application technique of Multi Method]

Thus, RT method compresses multivariate data into only two types of metrics by unit space. However, this method contains a risk that it might lose important information if RT method is applied to a large image, Therefore, RT method has an option called Multi method which divide the data in calculation (Fig. 13).

**(Fig. 13: Benefits of splitting an image)**

![imageRL1-25-13](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/imageRL1-25-13.jpg)

In particular, fluctuation of sensitivity was weak if circular shapes were evaluated by RT method such as face recognition. In that case, the classification accuracy can be improved by dividing the image.

### [Supplement-1: Precautions when recognizing images]

Thus, RT method outputs a distance like Mahalanobis method of multivariate normal distribution, but its mathematical meaning of the distance is completely different. The sensitivity of RT method is the first principal component of PCA, and SN ratio evaluates variation from the first principal component. It is shown clearly by comparing principal component analysis and RT distance under the same data (Fig. 14).

**(Fig. 14: Relationship between principal components and RT distance)**

![imageRL1-25-14](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/imageRL1-25-14.jpg)

Therefore, it is important that RT method cannot applied for omnidirectional evaluation like Mahalanobis method for classification of images from three-dimensional objects. It is shown that unit space should be collected via one direction (Fig. 15).

**(Fig. 15: Characteristics of RT method)**

![imageRL1-25-15](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/imageRL1-25-15.jpg)

In other words, user must decide whether to fluctuate horizontally or vertically to collect members of unit space (Fig. 15).

### [Supplement-2: Proposal for new RT method]

This invention proposes a "New RT method" to improve RT method easier to use and raise ability of the pattern discrimination compared to conventional one. Like conventional RT method, the new RT method consists of sensitivity (Y1) and SN ratio (Y2), of which sensitivity is defined the same. However, SN ratio of the new RT method applies Manhattan distance shown in Fig 16 (conventional SN ratio applies Euclidean distance).

**(Fig. 16: Formula for calculating Manhattan distance)**

![imageRL1-25-16](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/imageRL1-25-16.jpg)

The concept of new RT method is explained qualitatively (Fig 17). Given two vectors (multidimensional variables), a "standard vector" and a "measurement vector," the vectors are first rotated using a metric called sensitivity. Then, the difference between the standard vector and the measurement vector after the rotation is measured as a metric called SN ratio.

**(Fig. 17: Principle of RT metrics)**

![imageRL1-25-17](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/imageRL1-25-17.jpg)

This section explains a reason why Manhattan distance may increase the discrimination ability of the image. A game 2048 board is shown in Figure 18. The largest number on a tile on this board is 1024 (1 tile) and the smallest is 2 (6 tiles).

**(Fig. 18: Game 2048 board)**

![imageRL1-25-18](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/imageRL1-25-18.jpg)

According to Figure 19, numbers in the above figure are displayed in logarithmic form, and Euclidean and Manhattan distances were calculated using for above numbers. Pattern B copies numbers of Pattern A, but 2s and 4s are set to 0. After calculating sum-product of Pattern A and Pattern B, the ratio of these numbers explains “pattern discrimination ability”. The Manhattan distance (just sum) has a 14% higher discrimination ability than the Euclidean distance (sum of squares).

**(Fig. 19: Comparison of Pattern Discrimination Capabilities)**

![imageRL1-25-19](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/imageRL1-25-19.jpg)

Next, the characteristic differences between the new RT distance and the conventional RT distance is investigated. The change in SN ratio by shift and rotation of the same figure are shown in Figures 20 and 21. Although some differences are found in the numerical values of the distances, their characteristics (trends) are almost the same.

**(Fig. 20: Relation between shift of figure and SN ratio)**

![imageRL1-25-20](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/imageRL1-25-20.jpg)

**(Fig. 21: Relationship between rotation of figure and SN ratio)**

![imageRL1-25-21](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/imageRL1-25-21.jpg)

Next, a characteristic how SN ratio (Y2) is changed by type of shapes is tested. Although both conventional and new RT methods have similar trend, new one (Manhattan distance) has higher discrimination ability than conventional RT.

**(Fig. 22: Type of Shape to be tested)**

![imageRL1-25-22](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/imageRL1-25-22.jpg)

**(Fig. 23: Relationship between figure and SN ratio)**

![imageRL1-25-23](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/imageRL1-25-23.jpg)

Now, new RT method is applied to automatic inspection machine for connector terminal defects (Tanshi Nuke) to investigate discrimination capability of new RT method when it was applied to actual system (Fig 24- 26). Tanshi Nuke has two types of defects, terminal traction and tilt. And the conventional RT method did not have enough defect detection capability. On the other hand, new RT method can detect both defect modes.

**(Fig. 24, terminal tilted, conventional RT method used)**

![imageRL1-25-24](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/imageRL1-25-24.jpg)

**(Fig. 25, terminal tilted, new RT method used)**

![imageRL1-25-25](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/imageRL1-25-25.jpg)

**(Fig. 26, terminal traction, new RT method used)**

![imageRL1-25-26](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/imageRL1-25-26.jpg)

The effect of RT method on discrimination ability of inspection system is tested by applying RT method for preprocessing of defect detection system (Fig 26 and 27). The results showed that the system using new RT method has 20% higher performance than one with conventional RT method. Therefore, new RT method has higher discrimination ability than conventional one at least for certain types of images.
