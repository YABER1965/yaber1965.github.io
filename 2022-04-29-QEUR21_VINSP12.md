## QEUR21_VINSP12: オリエンテーション～ 補足(RT-Method, English ver.)

### [Preface]

RT method is a classification method proposed by Genichi Taguchi (田口 玄一, January 1, 1924-June 2, 2012, founder and engineer of Taguchi Method).

Genichi Taguchi proposed SN ratio (signal-to-noise ratio), which is a metric to evaluate quality performance in the 1980s. Then, he visited many companies that had many problems, and measured response of output under error factor added. And, he has made a number of remarkable achievements for product development and process improvement by solving equations with outer / inner orthogonal array (Fig. 1).

(Fig. 1: Structure of parameter design)

In the beginning of 2000s, Genichi Taguchi proposed a new metric called standard SN ratio, which is used to minimize output variability in products and processes with non-linearly variable standard (ideal) signals. One of the typical improvement examples is the improvement and stabilization of click feeling of the keypad by improving its design. It was improved by optimizing the thickness of each part of the silicon plate as control factors (Fig. 2).

(Fig. 2: Improvement example)

### [Mathematical understanding of RT method ①: Metrics Y1 and Y2]

RT method is a method that applies standard SN ratio to the classification problem of multivariate data although it is originally invented for improvement of product design and process.

Standard SN ratio evaluates the distribution of a non-linear signal by converting the standard signal value to the horizontal axis (Fig. 3). This conversion makes the distribution with proportional at origin, and its slope is defined as sensitivity, and its degree of variation from the standard signal is defined as SN ratio.

(Fig. 3: Standard SN ratio)

![image2-12B-4](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image2-12B-4.jpg)

This section describes a calculation flow to obtain two types of metrics (Y1 and Y2) (Fig. 4).

(Fig. 4: Process flow of the RT method)

![image2-12B-5](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image2-12B-5.jpg)

Unit space is defined as a "homogeneous group" to accumulates members (Xnk) that meet a condition. The mean value (Xk_bar) is calculated from the data in the unit space.

(Fig. 5: Unit space data and linear equation)

![image2-12B-6](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image2-12B-6.jpg)

The subsequent calculation procedure is shown as follows (Figs. 6 and 7).

(Fig. 6: Calculation of sensitivity and SN ratio - 1)

(Fig. 7: Calculation of sensitivity and SN ratio-2)

![image2-12B-8](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image2-12B-8.jpg)

Thus, we have obtained sensitivity (β) and SN ratio (η). It is required to convert them to Y1 and Y2 to use them for classification, (Fig. 8 and 9). These metrics calculated for each member are averaged by unit space to make Yi_bar and Y2_bar.

### [Mathematical understanding of RT method ②: Distance]

Distance (D) is introduced in this section for reference although it is not used directly in this invention. Distance of RT method is calculated in similar way as the Mahalanobis distance of the multivariate normal distribution. However, RT method uses Cofactor matrix of variance-covariance matrix instead of the inverse matrix (Figs. 10 and 11).

(Fig. 10: Calculation of RT distance - 1)

![image2-12B-11](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image2-12B-11.jpg)

(Fig. 11: Calculation of RT distance - 2)

![image2-12B-12](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image2-12B-12.jpg)

Finally, RT distance is calculated as follows (Fig. 12).

(Fig. 12: Calculation of RT distance - 3)

### [Application of Multi Method]

Thus, RT method compresses multivariate data into only two types of metrics by unit space. However, this method contains a risk that it might lose important information if RT method is applied to a large image, Therefore, RT method has an option called Multi method which divide the data in calculation (Fig. 13).

(Fig. 13: Multi-method approach)

![image2-12B-14](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image2-12B-14.jpg)

In particular, fluctuation of sensitivity was weak if circular shapes were evaluated by RT method such as face recognition. In that case, the classification accuracy can be improved by dividing the image.

### [Summary: Precautions for stereoscopic image recognition]

Thus, RT method outputs a distance like Mahalanobis method of multivariate normal distribution, but its mathematical meaning of the distance is completely different. The sensitivity of RT method is the first principal component of PCA, and SN ratio evaluates variation from the first principal component. It is shown clearly by comparing principal component analysis and RT distance under the same data (Fig. 14).

(Fig. 14: Principal Component Analysis and RT Distance)

![image2-12B-15](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image2-12B-15.jpg)

Therefore, it is important that RT method cannot applied for omnidirectional evaluation like Mahalanobis method for classification of images from three-dimensional objects. It is shown that unit space should be collected via one direction (Fig. 15).

(Fig. 15: RT distance features)

![image2-12B-16](https://yaber1965.github.io/images/image2-12B-16.jpg)

In other words, user must decide whether to fluctuate horizontally or vertically to collect members of unit space.

### [Postscript: Fusion of RT method and AI]

This invention does not classify images are not classified by RT method directly, but it applies RT method as an alternative dimension reduction method to PCA, and classification is performed by AI such as SVM (Fig. 16). This invention makes possible to change the number of unit spaces prepared by RT method and one of objects to be trained independently.
